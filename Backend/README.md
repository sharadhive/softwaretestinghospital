# Hospital Management System - Backend

This is the **Backend API** for the **Life Care Hospital** Management System. The backend handles patient and doctor registrations, authentication, appointment management, and communication between patients and the admin. It is built using **Node.js** and **Express.js**, with MongoDB as the database. This project also includes features like validation, error handling, token generation, and password encryption.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration for patients, doctors, and admins using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Password Encryption**: Uses bcrypt to securely hash and store passwords in the database.
- **Appointment Management**: Manage doctor-patient appointments via the backend API.
- **Cloudinary Integration**: Store doctor profile images in Cloudinary.
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling mechanism for better API management.
- **Validation**: Input validation using Mongoose and validator.js.
- **Role-Based Access**: Access control for different user roles (Admin, Patient, Doctor).
